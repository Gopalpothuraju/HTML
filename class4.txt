		PUBLIC STATIC VOID MAIN (STRING[] ARGS);
	===============================================================

main() 
=======
-->main is name of the function.
-->it is starting and ending of the program(cyclic);
-->main() function name is predefined &in between the function code is user defined


void
=====
--->main is not talking to OS directly because we can use void.
--->java is talking with JVM.
-->No need to return a value to JVM.JVM is always monitoring to program.
--->JVM is passed to OS.


static
=========
--->main function is not object level function.it is class level function.
**main function is common function called with class names.

**static function can be called with class names and object methods.

*********main is taking as static then object creation is not necesary

public
========
-->public is used for outside the function also.
-->function calling is done in anywhere.
JVM calls main(). then main() function and class having different places then we say as public.

string
=======

-->if INT takes only interger values are possible.
-->if double takes double and integer values are possible
etc........
every type having some restrictions but stribg does not have any restrictions then we can take any values usingg string

args
=====
-->we can pass arguments to string.

difference b/w string[] args & string args[]  
string args[]
--------------
-->C/C++ developers can use this
disadvantage:
============
unnecessarly developers can concentrate on variables.

string[] args
----------------
-->java developers can follow this type .

advantages:
==========
visibility and clarification
-->concentrating in dimensions & type




	WHY JAVA IS COMPLETE BUT NOT PURE OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING
=================================================================================

--->Java is complete OOP because of all the functions are written in class only.

C++ is partial/incomplete OOP because of caller functions in main and main() is outside the class.


===>without class name or without object cant take functions in java or CPP.
When you develop own types is called not pure or impure
				     ------------------
In java we can develop your own primitive types with the help of old types.therefoe, java is impure.

PURE OOP means
--------------
we cant develop own types is called pure.
In case of pure OOP ,type decarations are not possible.
pure object oriented having restrictions only defined objects are used.
pure OOP whatever available we use otherthan we cant use.

because of these reasons java developers use impure OOP (create your own type).


Impure OOP ,primiary types also available.



*************************************************************************************************************
IN JVM ,inbuilt programs is there,to find .class file this concept is called introspecror(or) reflection.




		OBJECT CREATION
	=============================================

syntax:
1.
class name  var_name= new classname();

var_name: after creation var_name converts to object name.
new: go to class declaration
classname() :automatic initializer or constructor in R.H.S

2.
classname varname;
varname=new classname();


L.H.S portion is identified at execution time.

automatic initializer
====================

-->it is called constructor
-->it is clear the garbage values in the object and replace with default values.

If you dont give any values in program then output shows default values,that default values are given from JVM having default constructor that constructor gives that default values.

Default consr=tructor is available but why developer can write a constructor in the program:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

user want to initialize objectswith user values during creation time.

benefits:
-------

size of the program decreases.
To remove garbage values 


default values:
==============
integer 	: 0
double   	: 0.0
character	:blank space(/000)
String		:null
boolean		:false
