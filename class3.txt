functions are 2 types
1.pre-defined
2.user defined

These 2 types of functions are used 2 keywords
1.static===>common functions/class level functions
2.Non-static===>instance functions /object level functions

4 types of packages in java

lang(java.lang)-->super class for all the classes
io (java.io)
net (java.net)

All the super classes
java.lang.Object
java.lang.System
java.lang.String
java.lang.StringBuffer


		STATIC
	============================
common functions
class level functions

It is common to every body is called class level functions
If static is effected ,total class effected.	
If sharing or common is available then it is static
It declare one member as static keyword is static.
This keyword could be given to class,variable,methods,block,objects.
Constructor never be static.

		NON-STATIC
	==============================
It is object level functions
Non static is effected ,only one object is effected.
-->variabke name is same but value is different then it is non static.


Static object can access all the objects.

class Student
{
int sno;
String sname;
Static String add;
static int busno;
}
Student s1=new Student();
Student s2=new Student();


s1-------------------->sno,sname--------
					|--add,busno
s2--------------------->sno,sname-------


how many number of functions available in java
17 types available in java

1.No return type and NO parameters(NRNP)
2.NO return type and WITH parameters(NRWP)
3.WITH return type and NO parameters(WRNP)
4.WITH return type and WITH parameter(WRWP)

every function have 4 types of return types 
1.primary
2.object
3.array
4.combination

1.NRNP
------
having only type of function because no parameters passing and no return type
ex:- sum()

2.NRWP
------
having 4 types of functions because having parameters in function name
ex: sum(int a);--->primitive
    sum(Addition a)--->object
    sum(int arr[])--->array
    sum(int a,Addition ab)--->combination

*********************Addition is a class name*********************
3.WRNP
------
having 4 types of functions because return type with no parameters
ex:     int sum()-->primitive
	Addition sum()-->object
	arr[] sum()-->array
	--combination

4.WRWP
-------
having 8 types of functions because of return type nd parameters available
ex:
	int sum(int a)
	int sum(Object obj)
	etcc.................
total 17types of functions are available in java

---->When you pass function as a parameter then it is called function as a parameter then it is called function oriented program.
	it is introduced in 1.8 version
	it is called 'lamda'
average(total())

			CASTING
		==============================

1.primary casting
2.object casting

casting are 2 types implict nd explict .these 2 are working with primary and object casting.
Creation of object in caller and callee.


Object x=t1.sum(10,20); //caller

Object sum
{
---
---
Object s1=new Object();
return s1;
}

//callee

s1 is a name is reference to the object.
An object can havde any no of references.
